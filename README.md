# WhisperGarden
Physical Computing Mid-term Project by Eli Zhang &amp; Maria Fang


This art installation features 40 purple LEDs that were programmed to "breath", with a distance sensor, 
and a background audio track of people whispering. 

The light goes out with a sound of gasp, if the sensor detects the appearance of users. 
This interaction tries to depict the ecology of big metropolitans with enclosed foreign communities 
who may find it hard to integrate to the local culture. 

In collaboration, Eli and his friend, Maria Fang, finished this project in 3 weeks, 
it being the first installation art work for both artists. 
Eli pitched and programmed the glowing effect and worked on the fabrication in collaboration with his partner.
